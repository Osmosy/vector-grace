Run the GRACE architectural planning phase.

## Prerequisites
- `docs/requirements.xml` must exist and have at least one UseCase
- `docs/technology.xml` must exist with stack decisions
- `docs/verification-plan.xml` should exist as the shared verification artifact template
- If requirements or technology are missing, tell the user to run `$grace-init` first
- If the verification plan template is missing, recreate it before finalizing the planning artifacts

## Architectural Principles

When designing the architecture, apply these principles:

### Contract-First Design
Every module gets a MODULE_CONTRACT before any code is written:
- PURPOSE: one sentence, what it does
- SCOPE: what operations are included
- DEPENDS: list of module dependencies
- LINKS: knowledge graph node references

### Module Taxonomy
Classify each module as one of:
- **ENTRY_POINT** — where execution begins (CLI, HTTP handler, event listener)
- **CORE_LOGIC** — business rules and domain logic
- **DATA_LAYER** — persistence, queries, caching
- **UI_COMPONENT** — user interface elements
- **UTILITY** — shared helpers, configuration, logging
- **INTEGRATION** — external service adapters

### Knowledge Graph Design
Structure `docs/knowledge-graph.xml` for maximum navigability:
- Each module gets a unique ID tag: `M-xxx NAME="..." TYPE="..."`
- Functions annotated as `fn-name`, types as `type-Name`
- CrossLinks connect dependent modules bidirectionally
- Annotations describe only the module's public interface
- Do not push private helpers or implementation-only types into shared XML artifacts

### Verification-Aware Planning
Planning is incomplete if modules cannot be verified.

For every significant module, define during planning:
- a `verification-ref` like `V-M-xxx`
- likely source and test file targets
- critical scenarios that must be checked
- the log or trace anchors needed to debug failures later
- which checks stay module-local versus wave-level or phase-level

### Phases With Checkpoints
Group modules into phases; close each phase with an explicit CHECKPOINT that enumerates the
conditions required to advance. A phase without a checkpoint is a pile of tasks.

A checkpoint lists:
- Which tests must pass (module-local, wave-level, phase-level)
- Which shared artifacts must be up to date (graph, plan, verification)
- Which cross-module flows must run end-to-end
- What to do if any check fails (which skill to invoke, how to rollback)

Checkpoints are not decoration — they are gates. The controller in `$grace-multiagent-execute`
reads them when deciding whether to advance waves.

### Dependency Discipline
Before adding a new module, new external dependency, or new cross-module CrossLink, run the
following discipline — record each answer in the plan's rationale block:

1. **Duplicate check** — does the existing graph already provide this capability? (`grace module find <query>`)
2. **Size estimate** — how many files / how much complexity? If the answer is "a lot", split now.
3. **Maintenance** — for external deps: is it actively maintained, what is the release cadence, who owns it upstream?
4. **License** — compatible with the project's license?
5. **Security** — known CVEs? (`npm audit` / ecosystem equivalent)
6. **Blast radius** — how many modules will import this? If many, consider whether it deserves its own module instead of inline use.

If the discipline surfaces a concern, write it as a `<risk>` entry in the plan. Do NOT silently
skip the check — the absence of a rationale block is itself a defect.

## Process

### Phase 1: Analyze Requirements
Read `docs/requirements.xml`. For each UseCase, identify:
- What modules/components are needed
- What data flows between them
- What external services or APIs are involved

### Phase 2: Design Module Architecture
Propose a module breakdown. For each module, define:
- Purpose (one sentence)
- Type: ENTRY_POINT / CORE_LOGIC / DATA_LAYER / UI_COMPONENT / UTILITY / INTEGRATION
- Dependencies on other modules
- Key public interfaces (what the module exposes to other modules or callers)
- Tentative source path, test path, and `verification-ref`

Present this to the user as a structured list and **wait for approval** before proceeding.

### Phase 3: Design Verification Surfaces
Before finalizing the plan, derive the first verification draft:
- map critical UseCases to `DF-xxx` data flows
- assign `V-M-xxx` verification entries for important modules
- list the most important success and failure scenarios
- identify required log markers or trace evidence for critical branches
- note module-local checks plus any wave-level or phase-level follow-up

Present this verification draft to the user as part of the same approval checkpoint. If the verification story is weak, revise the architecture before proceeding.

### Phase 4: Mental Walkthroughs
Run "mental tests" for 2-3 key user scenarios step by step:
- Which modules are involved?
- What data flows through them?
- Where could it break?
- Which logs or trace markers would prove the path was correct?
- Are there circular dependencies?

Present the walkthrough to the user. If issues are found — revise the architecture.

### Phase 5: Generate Artifacts
After user approval:

1. Update `docs/development-plan.xml` with the full module breakdown, public module contracts, target paths, observability notes, data flows, and implementation order. Use unique ID-based tags: `M-xxx` for modules, `Phase-N` for phases, `DF-xxx` for flows, `step-N` for steps, and `V-M-xxx` references for verification.
2. Update `docs/verification-plan.xml` with global verification policy, critical flows, module verification stubs, and phase gates.
3. Update `docs/knowledge-graph.xml` with all modules (as `M-xxx` tags), their public-interface annotations (as `fn-name`, `type-Name`, etc.), `verification-ref` links, and CrossLinks between them.
4. Print: "Architecture approved. Run `$grace-verification` to deepen tests and trace expectations, `$grace-execute` for sequential execution, or `$grace-multiagent-execute` for parallel-safe waves."

## Important
- Do NOT generate any code during this phase
- This phase produces ONLY planning documents and verification artifacts
- Every architectural decision must be explicitly approved by the user

## Output Format
Always produce:
1. Module breakdown table (ID, name, type, purpose, dependencies, target paths, verification ref)
2. Data flow diagrams (textual)
3. Verification surface overview (critical flows, module-local checks, log or trace anchors)
4. Implementation order grouped into **phases with checkpoints** (each phase ends with enumerated gate conditions)
5. Risk assessment (what could go wrong, including open dependency-discipline concerns)

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Architecture is obvious, skip the mental walkthrough" | Obvious to you may be wrong. The walkthrough IS the verification. Every skipped walkthrough is a bug you paid for later. |
| "We can refactor module boundaries later" | Boundaries are contracts. Refactoring them later breaks every dependent agent. Plan right the first time. |
| "Verification-ref can be added after we have tests" | Without V-M-xxx on the plan, execution will ship modules without verification entries. Plan the verification surface with the architecture. |
| "We do not need phases for a small project" | Even 5-module projects benefit from at least one checkpoint. Without it the 'done' signal is vibes. |
| "Adding a new dep is a one-liner, skip the discipline" | The discipline takes 2 minutes. Debugging a supply-chain mistake takes 2 weeks. |
| "Plan is just a draft, approval is a formality" | User approval is the only gate that separates GRACE from waterfall-with-extra-steps. Never skip it. |

## Red Flags

- You are writing code before user has approved the module breakdown.
- You added a new module without a V-M-xxx entry.
- You added a phase without a closing checkpoint.
- You added an external dependency without running the discipline.
- Your plan has no `<risk>` block — every non-trivial plan has risks worth naming.

## When NOT to Use

- A bug fix with clear root cause — use `$grace-fix` instead (no architectural change).
- A pure rename / move / split / merge — use `$grace-refactor`.
- Exploratory spike where contracts are intentionally informal — label the spike as non-GRACE and revisit plan when the spike concludes.
- The requirements are still in flux. Return to `$grace-init` to firm up `docs/requirements.xml` first.

## Verification

After running this skill:

- [ ] `docs/development-plan.xml` has at least one Phase-N with a checkpoint block (verification: grep for `<checkpoint`)
- [ ] Every module in the plan has a V-M-xxx reference (verification: no M-xxx lacks `verification-ref`)
- [ ] `docs/knowledge-graph.xml` lists every planned module with unique `M-xxx` tags (verification: `grace module find --path .` returns expected count)
- [ ] `docs/verification-plan.xml` has stub V-M-xxx entries for every module (verification: grep for each `V-M-xxx`)
- [ ] User has explicitly approved module breakdown and verification surface (verification: attach approval message)
- [ ] Dependency discipline rationale recorded for every new external dep (verification: each new dep has its own `<rationale>` block)
